        <h2>First Aid Tips</h2>
        <p>First aid knowledge can save lives during emergencies. Below are some basic first aid tips you should know:</p>

        <h3>1. CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation)</h3>
        <p>CPR is used when someone’s breathing or heartbeat has stopped. Follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Check if the person is unresponsive and not breathing.</li>
            <li>Call for emergency help immediately (Dial the emergency number).</li>
            <li>Start chest compressions by pressing down hard and fast (about 2 inches deep, 100-120 compressions per minute).</li>
            <li>Give rescue breaths if trained, or continue with chest compressions until help arrives.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>2. Choking</h3>
        <p>If someone is choking, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ask the person to cough or try to expel the object.</li>
            <li>If they can’t, perform the Heimlich maneuver (abdominal thrusts) by standing behind them, placing your hands just above their navel, and pulling inward and upward.</li>
            <li>Repeat until the object is expelled or the person starts breathing again.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>3. Bleeding</h3>
        <p>If someone is bleeding, take the following actions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Apply direct pressure to the wound using a clean cloth or bandage.</li>
            <li>Elevate the injured area above the heart if possible.</li>
            <li>If bleeding doesn’t stop, apply more pressure and seek medical help.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>4. Burns</h3>
        <p>For minor burns, follow these steps:</p>

            <li>Run cold water over the burn for at least 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cover the burn with a clean, non-stick bandage.</li>
            <li>Avoid breaking blisters and seek medical help for serious burns.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>5. Fractures and Sprains</h3>
        <p>If someone is injured with a broken bone or sprain, take the following actions:</p>

            <li>Do not hold the person down or try to put anything in their mouth.</li>
            <li>Once the seizure stops, turn the person onto their side to keep the airway clear.</li>
            <li>Seek medical attention if it’s the first seizure or if the seizure lasts more than 5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
